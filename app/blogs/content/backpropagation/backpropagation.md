# Understanding Multi-Layer Perceptron Neural Networks

Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) neural networks are a fundamental concept in deep learning. They consist of multiple layers of interconnected nodes, or "neurons," that process and transform input data to produce meaningful output.

## Structure of an MLP

An MLP typically consists of three types of layers:

1. Input Layer: Receives the initial data
2. Hidden Layer(s): Processes the data
3. Output Layer: Produces the final result

Each neuron in these layers is connected to every neuron in the adjacent layers, forming a fully connected network.

## Forward Propagation

During forward propagation, data flows from the input layer through the hidden layers to the output layer. At each neuron, the input is multiplied by weights, summed, and then passed through an activation function.

Here's a simple example in Python:

```python
def forward_propagation(inputs, weights):
    layer1 = np.dot(inputs, weights[0])
    activation1 = sigmoid(layer1)
    layer2 = np.dot(activation1, weights[1])
    output = sigmoid(layer2)
    return output

def sigmoid(x):
    return 1 / (1 + np.exp(-x))
```

## Backpropagation

Backpropagation is the key algorithm used to train MLPs. It adjusts the weights of the network to minimize the difference between the predicted output and the actual output.

The process involves:

1. Calculating the error at the output layer
2. Propagating this error backwards through the network
3. Adjusting weights based on their contribution to the error

Here's a simplified version of backpropagation:

<Test />

```python
def backpropagation(inputs, targets, outputs, weights):
    output_error = targets - outputs
    output_delta = output_error * sigmoid_derivative(outputs)

    hidden_error = np.dot(output_delta, weights[1].T)
    hidden_delta = hidden_error * sigmoid_derivative(hidden_layer)

    weights[1] += learning_rate * np.dot(hidden_layer.T, output_delta)
    weights[0] += learning_rate * np.dot(inputs.T, hidden_delta)

def sigmoid_derivative(x):
    return x * (1 - x)
```

## Visualization of Weight Adjustment

Below is an interactive visualization showing how weights might change during the backpropagation process:

In this visualization, you can see three weights being adjusted over time. Each iteration represents a round of backpropagation. The "Adjust Weights" button simulates a manual round of backpropagation.

## Conclusion

MLPs and backpropagation form the foundation of many modern deep learning techniques. While more advanced architectures exist, understanding these core concepts is crucial for anyone diving into the field of neural networks and machine learning.
